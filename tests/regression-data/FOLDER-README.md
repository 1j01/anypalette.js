# Regression Testing Data

This folder contains parsed palettes in a uniform format, but it's not *what's correct*, it's not the *spec*, it's simply the output of AnyPalette.js currently.

The purpose is to immediately see and understand behavioral changes.

The parsed palettes are expressed in text, so the changes can be viewed in Git.  
(Ideally you'd be able to view the diff of the colors visually too, but I just compare numbers and sometimes drag palettes into the demo to verify they look reasonable.)

See [Development Workflow](../../README.md#development-workflow), and [test.coffee](../test.coffee) for more information.
